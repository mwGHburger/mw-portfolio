            <p>First of all my is Michael and I currently aspire to be a software developer.
        My decision to pursue the path of software developer was after several years working
        within the Professional Services industry at Deloitte. I like to see myself as highly-motivated
        individual who always loves to learn new things and to embrace change and challenges. In my spare time,
        I like to make myself useful as wedding photographer/videographer. Otherwise, I love to geek around with games and tv shows/movies.
        I love food. I make time for friends and family as I feel they keep me grounded as a human being. 
        At the same time, itâ€™s very important to me to maintain physical and especially mental wellbeing so try keep a habit of going to the gym and occasionally meditate.</p>
